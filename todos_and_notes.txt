How to support different roles? atm there is only validation of users
through JWT. But there needs to be a separation between student-users and
company-users.

======
todo:

add support for whishes to the student struct, the student can display his whishes in this string

maybe make it so only company recruiters/representatives can view the profiles and cards of
students. Most people wouldn't want other students look into their profile / resume.
add validate check so only users with the role 'representative' can call findStudentbyID
Problem it must also be possible to view your own profile. So findStudentByID must be
callable by representatives and by the owner of the profile.
How to do this?

replace that statuses of the students from 'available' and 'unavailable'
to 'student' and possible 'newly graduate' 

extend logging middleware, log more things. e.g. who makes the request
etc.

transform the fields of the structs so they look nice.
e.g firstname must be transformed to capitalized version,
etc.

add query params for /students/all, so the client can specify
how many students they want. Otherwise all students are returned all
the time.

look into cors. i added a Go library to allow crosse origin requests.
this way requests can be made from the cscoupler-client

look into renaming of routes/endpoints. They don't really make sense.

maybe add an ordering to the skills of the student
so they can say in which skills they are most skilled.
At the other hand, this sounds pretty stupid.

look into security in combination with jwt, how to invalidate a token

look into cookie attributes and other safety measures

look into update/edit student account. What fields should the user
be able to edit. Important fields are password and emailaddress.
When can they edit those.

look at errors returned, and at the errors looked for in the 
handlers. This isn't correct atm.

use docker

rename all files to snake case equivalent
student_repo intead of studentRepo

improve error messages, atm i print some message,
but there is no stack trace. sooo it sucks massively

------
But what happens if a student wants to comment on a posted project of a company.
Does this message get sent to a random representative of this company?
Or can the user chose one of the representatives that the company has, and sent a message to
the selected one?
------ 

create client for cscoupler, probably in a different repo called vue-cscoupler or client-cscoupler
the only thing is that if client-cscoupler is used, how should other clients be called which are made
with different technologies / are not webbased. On the other hand, idc

features:
students can create accounts
add skills, cv, wants (things they want), university, name, etc.

companies can create an account
add projects for which they search students
they can be internship projects or work-projects for students
    (this should/ can be a flag)
they can message a student they are interested in, maybe link to a specific project
they offer if they think the student is suited for that one. Or not if they are just
interested in the student in general

-------------------------------------------------------
???How to make sure people don't just spam everyone???
Maybe add a timer. Someone can only message someone else  
if he/she looked at their account for 20 sec or something.
Sounds kinda shitty though
-------------------------------------------------------

for later:
maybe add support for the creation of teams for students between themselves.
a student can create a project with a description, vision, goal, etc. And if other students
are interested of teaming up, they can respond.

HandlerFunc creates a handler from a normal func
